# Salary-Analysis-and-Forecast (R)
This is a final project of Regression Analysis & Statistical Modeling course. The goal of this project is to understand the relationship between salary and information of employees on the Human Resource dataset, which enables us to have a better understanding of the main drivers which determine salaries. We also further analyze some issues related to gender equality or racial biases. In this project, we applied multiple linear regression to fit the human resource data, and using variable selection to reduce the number of variables and avoid the issue of multicollinearity. The result could be used to investigate the gender equality of salary and predict the upcoming employees' salaries.
